This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unusual or unexpected file structure, or when certain dependencies conflict with Expo's internal mechanisms.  It might manifest as cryptic error messages during build or start commands, or might cause unexpected behavior within the app itself.  Debugging often requires careful examination of package.json, app.json, and the project's file structure to find inconsistencies or conflicts. The errors are often non-specific and require a deep understanding of Expo's build process.
