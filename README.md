# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides solutions to resolve them.  These errors often stem from unconventional project setups, dependency conflicts, or interactions with Expo's internal mechanisms.  Debugging these errors typically requires a deep understanding of the Expo build process and careful examination of your project files.

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

* **Unexpected file structures:**  Ensure your project follows Expo's recommended structure. Unconventional folder layouts or file placements can lead to errors.
* **Dependency conflicts:** Conflicts between your project's dependencies and Expo's internal modules can cause unusual behavior. Carefully review `package.json` for conflicting or incompatible packages.
* **Incorrect configuration:**  Issues with `app.json` or `babel.config.js` can lead to build failures. Verify the correctness of your configuration files.
* **Native module integration:** Problems integrating native modules can lead to cryptic errors. Ensure you're following the official Expo documentation for native module integration.
