Debugging these errors often involves a systematic approach:

1. **Examine the full error message:** Expo CLI errors sometimes provide clues to the problem's origin. Look for specific file paths or dependency names mentioned in the error message.
2. **Check `package.json`:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Expo. Look for version conflicts or outdated packages.
3. **Review `app.json`:** Verify that the configuration in this file is correct and matches your project setup.
4. **Simplify your project:** Try creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the cause of the error.
5. **Search for similar issues:** Search online forums and the Expo community for similar error messages or problem descriptions.  Many common issues have already been addressed and solutions are available.
6. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a simple `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` or a clean build process can resolve temporary or transient issues.
7. **Inspect build logs:** Look for more detailed information in the Expo build logs.  These logs often contain information not visible in the terminal output.

If the problem remains, please provide detailed information about your setup (including the exact error message, relevant parts of your `package.json`, and your project structure) to aid in further debugging.
